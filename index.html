                                        I can’t recall the very first time I said it, but it stuck.  These words are the foundation of my first-day-of-school speech, the words of wisdom I send my 8thgraders off to high school with, and Miss King’s classroom mantra.  When the going gets tough, I begin to tell my students, “I will never” and they help me finish with, “give you something you can’t do.”  My students know that it may not always be easy, but with hard work they can and will be successful in our classroom.



In junior high, students in special education are aware of their own challenges and want to have access to same material as their peers.  They want to feel that what they are learning is meaningful and real.  They want to engage in authentic learning tasks.  Not only have authentic learning opportunities been found to increase self-efficacy in students, they also facilitate intrinsic motivation and support the development of 21stcentury skills (Westberg & Leppien, 2018, p. 14).  Self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, and 21stcentury skills are imperative to the lifelong success of all students, especially students in special education.  Authentic learning opportunities give students a safe and supportive environment to explore academic skills in real-world contexts and discover first-hand why they are important to them.



I will never give you something you can’t do.



With this promise comes big responsibility. Research shows that students with low self-efficacy display avoidance behaviors when presented with difficult tasks.  Students with strong self-efficacy embrace difficult learning tasks and persevere through challenges (Myeong-Hee, 2018, p. 208).  Although authentic learning tasks are meant to be challenging and contextualized, I have to be sure I meet my students at their instructional levels. To do this, I continually assess their skills using formative and summative assessments strategies.  I also rely on collaborating with my team of support staff members to add the finishing touches to my lessons.  They help me think of scaffolded supports for specific students, encourage me when I begin to second guess myself, and provide additional student supports with more challenging endeavors.



I will never give you something you can’t do.



Miss King’s classroom mantra is how I support student’s levels of self-efficacy.  It builds their trust in me.  It reassures my students that I understand that they are faced with a challenging task and reminds them that they can succeed.

                                        How I Designed My Classroom for Collaborative Group Work



In the past, the majority of my lessons have been whole group or leveled group instruction.  This year I made it a personal goal to implement more student-centered, collaborative work, throughout all content areas.  My students typically struggle with executive functioning and social skills when carrying out academic tasks and I wanted to give them authentic contexts to practice these critical life skills necessary in our 21stcentury world.  I knew that for these efforts to be successful, I had to create an environment that facilitated collaboration and equipped my students with the tools necessary for success.



The first step was to ditch traditional desks.  It had to be done and let me tell you I am never going back!  I replaced the traditional desks with large tables.  Each table seats two students and gives them substantial room to work.  Since I only had eight students this year, I only needed four large tables.  The aesthetics alone made the switch worth it!  My classroom felts so much more open, clean, and like a collaborative environment.  Even my students loved it the moment they saw it!



It didn’t take long before I found myself saying, “turn to your table partner” in every class.  It was working!  Since the tables were large, I could even have the front table rotate their chairs to easily join the back tables to form two groups.  Why didn’t I make this switch earlier?



Next, I had to create spaces for students to collaborate away from their table desks.  I already had a front and back round table.  All I really had to add to each table was a carousel of supplies.  This gave students easy access to colored pens, sticky notes, highlighters, money for math, and a stapler.  This way they had everything they needed to be independent in carrying out tasks without interrupting students in other parts of the classroom.  Not to mention it gave my students a sense of responsibility over their learning.  The tables were large enough that they were able to bring their tablets and books along and still have plenty of room to work closely together.



I knew that if I wanted my new student-centered and collaborative efforts to be successful I had to create an environment that facilitated the process.  Making the switch to tables was the best system I implemented in my classroom to date.  By providing my students with a comfortable environment to carry out collaborative tasks in, they were able to focus on learning.  Following the switch, not only did I noticed an improvement in their academics, but amazing gains in their social skills and ability to collaborate without prompting.  Even though summer just started, I am already thinking of more ways to reinforce a collaborative classroom.  Flexible seating options?  Stay tuned! ANNA KING
